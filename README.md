![Screenshot](./studio.png)

Metacity Studio is an online tool for integrating and visualization of spatial data.

Running at [studio.metacity.cc](https://studio.metacity.cc)

## How does it work?

Prepare urban visualizations online. Load your data, align it, and export it for viewing online.

-   works best with small to medium-sized datasets
-   allows yout to connect 3D models and metadata

## What formats can you load in?

Currently:

-   SHP (Polygons and MultiPatch only for now)
-   IFC
-   GLTF (triangles only)
-   Metacity File Format (binary Studio export)

---

## Planned Releases

These features are planned for the future, and scheduled for a specific release.

### v0.5.3 - Work in progress

    -   [x] Colorize model
    -   [x] Heatmap legendg
-   [x] Updated file extension (replacing .metacity with .mcmodel and .json.metactiy with .mcstyle), still supports the old extensions tho
-   [x] Tooltip on hover over model and labels in 3D
-   [x] FIX: Firefox handling mouse events for hover
-   [x] Refactor processing status - https://github.com/MetacityTools/Studio/issues/33

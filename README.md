# Metacity Studio

Metacity Studio is an online tool for integrating spatial and tabular data, visualizing it and converting it to a fun, grid-like format.

## How does it work?

You come to the app, you upload your data, you mess around with it, you save it and download the result to your computer. That's it.

The application is front-end only, meaning that all the data processing is done in the browser. It may seem crazy, mangling large datasets in the browser, computing geometry and on top of that, rendering it all in a 3D environment.

Only time will tell if this is a good idea.

## What formats can you load in?

Currently:

-   None

but we are working on adding formats such as:

-   CSV
-   GeoJSON
-   Shapefiles
-   IFC
-   GLTF

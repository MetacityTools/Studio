Metacity Studio is an online tool for integrating and visualizing spatial and tabular data.

## How does it work?

Open the app, upload your data, see what's there. That's it.

The application is front-end only, all the data processing is done in the browser.

It may seem crazy, mangling large datasets in the browser, computing geometry and on top of that, rendering it all in a 3D environment.

Only time will tell if this is a good idea.

## What formats can you load in?

Currently:

-   SHP (Polygons and MultiPatch only)
-   IFC
-   GLTF (triangles only)

# üè° [Metacity Studio](https://studio.metacity.cc)

![Screenshot](./studio.png)

Metacity Studio is an online tool for integrating and visualization of spatial data.

Running at [studio.metacity.cc](https://studio.metacity.cc)

## How does it work?

Prepare urban visualizations online. Load your data, align it, and export it for viewing online.

-   works best with small to medium-sized datasets
-   allows yout to connect 3D models and metadata

## What formats can you load in?

Currently:

-   SHP (Polygons and MultiPatch only for now)
-   IFC
-   GLTF (triangles only)
-   Metacity File Format (binary Studio export)

## Roadmap

The project is in active development. The roadmap is as follows:

---

## Backlog

These features are planned for the future, but not yet scheduled.

### Priority Backlog

-   [ ] Filter file inputs (add format filters)
-   [ ] Click off model - deselect all
-   [ ] Group selection in hierarchy tree optimization (shift to select, deselect previous on selectiong previous)
-   [ ] Shortcuts for tab switching in editor
-   [ ] When in Table view, click to select model and extend the selection based on groups on key/button/action

### Backlog

-   [ ] Loading GeoJSON
-   [ ] Loading IFC metadata loading (memory-efficiency???)
-   [ ] Frustum culling
-   [ ] Connect to on-line storage and model admin
-   [ ] Extract Utils to separate SDK form metacity editors
-   [ ] Optional interactivity - build BVH only if user opts-in to make the loaded models clickable
-   [ ] Optimize deleting models - partition model BVH nodes based on submodels's ids
-   [ ] Insert textured plane (location blueprints for reference)
-   [ ] Refactor General context - setting status messages, etc.
-   [ ] Add a button to open/hide the side panel

### Bugs and Validations

-   [ ] Do not allow keys to be empty in table view during conversion

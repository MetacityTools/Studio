                Metacity Studio is a front-end only application with no backend or server-side
                components. We do not collect any personal data, use telemetry, or track user
                activity. We prioritize data security and have implemented measures to protect the
                limited data we process. For more detailed information, please read the following
                Privacy Policy.

            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how Metacity Studio ("we," "us," or "our") collects,
                uses, and discloses information when you use the Metacity Studio website
                (studio.metacity.cc) ("Website") and the Metacity Studio application
                ("Application"). By accessing or using the Website or Application, you acknowledge
                that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the
                practices described in this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Website or
                Application.
            </p>

            <h2>Information Collection</h2>

            <p>
                We want to assure you that Metacity Studio does not collect any personal data or
                personally identifiable information when you use our Website or Application. We
                designed Metacity Studio to be a front-end only application with zero backend and no
                server-side components. Therefore, we do not request or store any personal
                information such as your name, email address, or any other identifying information.
            </p>

            <h2>Usage Data and Telemetry</h2>

            <p>
                Metacity Studio does not utilize any telemetry or analytics tools to collect data on
                how the Application is used. We do not collect information about the features you
                use, actions you take, or any other usage statistics.
            </p>

            <h2>Cookies</h2>

            <p>
                Metacity Studio does not use any cookies or similar tracking technologies on the
                Website or within the Application. We do not store any information on your device
                that would be retrieved during subsequent visits.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

            <p>
                Metacity Studio does not integrate any third-party services that collect user data
                or track user activity. Our Application operates solely on the client-side, without
                any reliance on external services.
            </p>

            <p>
                While Metacity Studio currently does not integrate with any third-party services
                that collect user data or track user activity, we are considering the possibility of
                introducing integration with Google Sheets and Google Login in the future. It's
                important to note that even if we implement these integrations, we will not collect
                or store any data through them. Any data exchange with Google Sheets will be solely
                for the purpose of providing you with seamless access to your own data, and any use
                of Google Login will be limited to authentication purposes. We are committed to
                maintaining the same high level of privacy and data protection standards, and we
                will update this Privacy Policy accordingly if and when these integrations are
                implemented. Rest assured that we will never access, use, or store any of your
                personal data without your explicit consent.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>

            <p>
                Although we do not collect any personal information, we take data security
                seriously. We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to
                protect the limited data that we do process. However, please note that no method of
                transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute
                security of the information.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any
                material changes by posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Website. It is your
                responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates or
                changes.
            </p>
